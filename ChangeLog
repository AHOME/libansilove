- Remove superfluous background color allocations in the Binary, PCBoard
  and XBin loaders
- Modify the PCBoard loader to use a cursor pointer to parse input
- Infer font height to 16 in the XBin loader, the default in absence of
  font data (Thanks Andrew Herbert)



libansilove 1.1.2 (2019-04-30)

- Use 'xbin_fontsize' for character height instead of an hardcoded value,
  fixes a rendering bug reported by Bart Dumon

libansilove 1.1.1 (2019-02-11)

- Add install target for man page
- Use the correct idiom for realloc, to avoid leaking memory if allocation
  fails

  called after gdImagePngPtr() (Thanks Andrew Michaelson)



libansilove 1.1.0 (2019-01-15)

- Only call gdFree() if the PNG buffer was allocated (Thanks Joris Vink)
- No need for buffer pointers to be const, they're passed to functions
  taking non consts (Thanks Joris Vink)
- Introduce a maplen variable to allow tracking mmap size, as we can't
  rely on the length variable because of SAUCE
- Unmap ctx->buffer on cleanup (Thanks Joris Vink)
- Check for the TUNDRA24 string in TND files header
- Split fonts data to have one include file per font
- Use macros instead of hardcoded values in the Tundra loader
