- Only call gdFree() if the PNG buffer was allocated (Thanks Joris Vink)
- No need for buffer pointers to be const, they're passed to functions
  taking non consts. (Thanks Joris Vink)
- Introduce a maplen variable to allow tracking mmap size, as we can't
  rely on the length variable because of SAUCE
- Unmap ctx->buffer on cleanup. From Joris Vink, thanks!
- Check for the TUNDRA24 string in TND files header
- Split fonts data to have one include file per font
- Use macros instead of hardcoded values in the Tundra loader
- Use 'X' instead of integer value for the start of SGR sequences
- Always check that seqTok is not NULL before using it
- Move the include guards to the top of header files
