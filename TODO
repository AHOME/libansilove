- Increment ansi_buffer by more than one element at a time when using realloc
  in order to avoid wasting memory. Switch to OpenBSD reallocarray?
- Use include-what-you-use to remove unnecessary headers
- Parse ANSI in two pass, like we do for Tundra, to avoid storing temporary
  data and save memory?
- Add an error function?
- Use OpenBSD style(9) for function prototypes and declarations?
- Be more resilient with corrupt files, especially ADF / IDF / XBIN files
  with malformed headers
- Fix rendering bugs in the PabloDraw 24-bit ANSI sequences handling
- Fuzz with AFL, especially for non ANSI formats
- Allow enabling DOS aspect ratio + retina at the same time
- Split fonts to have one include file per font
- Check for the TUNDRA24 string in TND files header
